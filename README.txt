This is the Git repository for RSC code.
RSC stands for random spherically-constrained single-particle reconstruction.
It is a method for obtaining 3D structures of membrane proteins by electron
cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM).  The image-processing code in this repository runs
under Matlab and does various steps in the processing of micrographs and 3D
reconstruction of the single protein "particles".
