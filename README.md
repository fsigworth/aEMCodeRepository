Matlab code for cryo-EM single-particle image analysis
This is the set of functions my lab uses for single-particle reconstruction using the Random Spherically Constrained (RSC) method for obtaining structures of membrane proteins reconstituted into lipid vesicles. Receint additions include interfaces to Relion and other programs.
